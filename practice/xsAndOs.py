# 6. Are the Xs equal to the Os?
# Create a Python function that accepts a string. 
# This function should count the number of Xs and the number of Os in the string. 
# It should then return a boolean value of either True or False.
# If the count of Xs and Os are equal, then the function should return True. 
# If the count isn't the same, it should return False. 
# If there are no Xs or Os in the string, it should also return True because 0 equals 0. 
# The string can contain any type and number of characters.

def countXsAndOs(howMuchDoYouLoveMe):
    Os = howMuchDoYouLoveMe.count('x')
    Xs = howMuchDoYouLoveMe.count('o')
    if Os == Xs:
        return True
    else:
        return False

print(countXsAndOs("asdxxxooosss")) #True
print(countXsAndOs("adfgasdgxxxoooosss")) #False
print(countXsAndOs("ssss")) #True
